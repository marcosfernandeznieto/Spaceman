# Spaceman
#First C# porject for the SoftwareONE Academy

Overview
This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

Project Goals
Invaders from outer space have arrived and are abducting humans using tractor beams. Players must crack the codeword to stop the abduction!

Ok, we’ll admit it’s quite a bit like that classic game, “Hangman”, but with a better premise. Plus, building this command-line game was the Codecademy 2019 Software Engineer Internship Backend Programming Challenge!
